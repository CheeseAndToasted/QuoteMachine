REPO for random quote machine project. 

This will be my first experience dealing with JSON.  I plan on using Bootstrap to help it look pretty, FontAwesome and JQUERY to pull it all together.  

This project is based off of FreeCodeCamp's random quote machine challenge so I will also incoroporate twitter posting and maybe a facebook share button as well. 

Wish me luck :D
